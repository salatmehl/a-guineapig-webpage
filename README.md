This is a webpage I use to practice RegEx and set up GTM tags/variables.

Hi again!

<b>Why this webpage is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on Regular Expressions. Used in digital marketing for creating precise triggers/variables and performing advanced filtering RegEx can be actively used in tools like Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. A webpage below was created to practice RegEx whilst setting up triggers/variables in GTM.
